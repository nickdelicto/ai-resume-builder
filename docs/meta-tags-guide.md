# Meta Tags Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the best practices for implementing meta tags across the IntelliResume website to ensure consistency and optimize for SEO.

## Using the Meta Component

We've created a reusable `Meta` component located at `components/common/Meta.jsx` that should be used on all pages. This component handles:

- Title tags (with optimal length)
- Meta descriptions (with optimal length)
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Twitter card tags
- Canonical URLs
- Keywords

## Implementation Example

```jsx
import Meta from '../components/common/Meta';

export default function YourPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Meta 
        title="Page Title | IntelliResume"
        description="Concise description of the page content that encourages clicks (150-160 characters max)"
        canonicalUrl="https://intelliresume.net/your-page"
        keywords="comma, separated, keywords, for, seo"
      />
      {/* Page content */}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Canonical URLs for Resume Builder Entry Points

We have multiple paths that lead to the same functionality. To avoid duplicate content issues, we've established these official canonical URLs:

1. **Create New Resume**: `https://intelliresume.net/new-resume-builder`
2. **Import Resume**: `https://intelliresume.net/resume-import`
3. **Job Targeting**: `https://intelliresume.net/job-targeting`

Always use these canonical URLs in the `canonicalUrl` prop when implementing the Meta component on these pages or their alternate paths.

## Meta Tag Best Practices

### Title Tags
- Keep between 55-60 characters
- Include the main keyword near the beginning
- Use the format: `[Page Title] | IntelliResume`
- Be descriptive and compelling

### Meta Descriptions
- Keep between 150-160 characters
- Include 1-2 relevant keywords naturally
- Write in an active voice with a clear value proposition
- Include a call-to-action when appropriate

### Keywords
- Include 5-8 relevant keywords separated by commas
- Focus on terms users might search for
- Include variations of important terms

### Open Graph and Twitter Cards
- These are automatically generated by the Meta component
- Ensure each page has a relevant title and description
- Custom OG images can be specified with the `ogImage` prop

## Page-Specific Guidelines

### Home Page
- Title: Focus on the brand and main value proposition
- Description: Highlight the main benefits of using IntelliResume

### Resume Builder Pages
- Title: Be specific about the action (Create, Import, Tailor)
- Description: Emphasize ease of use and benefits

### Pricing/Subscription Pages
- Title: Include "Plans" or "Pricing" keywords
- Description: Highlight value and any special offers

## Regular Audits

Conduct regular audits of meta tags across the site to ensure:
- All pages use the Meta component
- Titles and descriptions are within optimal character limits
- Canonical URLs are correctly implemented
- Keywords are relevant and up-to-date

## Testing Your Meta Tags

After implementing meta tags, test them using:
1. [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
2. [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
3. [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
4. [SEO Meta in 1 Click](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seo-meta-in-1-click/bjogjfinolnhfhkbipphpdlldadpnmhc) Chrome extension

## Additional Considerations

- **Structured Data**: Continue using the StructuredData component alongside Meta
- **Mobile Optimization**: All meta tags should be mobile-friendly
- **Regular Audits**: Review meta tags quarterly to ensure they remain relevant and effective

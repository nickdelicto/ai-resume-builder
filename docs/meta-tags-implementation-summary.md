# Meta Tags Implementation Summary

## Implemented Improvements

1. **Created a reusable Meta component**
   - Located at `components/common/Meta.jsx`
   - Handles title, description, canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, Twitter cards, and keywords
   - Enforces best practices for character limits

2. **Updated key entry point pages with optimized meta tags**
   - `/new-resume-builder`: Create a new resume from scratch
   - `/resume-import`: Import an existing resume
   - `/job-targeting`: Tailor a resume to a specific job
   - `/job-targeting/resume-source`: Choose resume source for job targeting

3. **Established canonical URLs**
   - Identified official entry points to prevent duplicate content issues
   - Set canonical URLs in the Meta component for each page
   - Updated sitemap configuration to prioritize canonical URLs

4. **Updated sitemap generation**
   - Excluded duplicate paths from the sitemap
   - Set higher priority (0.9) for the canonical resume builder entry points
   - Regenerated the sitemap with updated configuration

5. **Created documentation**
   - Updated meta tags guide with canonical URL information
   - Added best practices for meta tag implementation
   - Included page-specific guidelines

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Meta component on remaining pages**
   - Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, About Us, Contact Us
   - Any additional content pages

2. **Regular auditing**
   - Set up a schedule to audit meta tags across the site
   - Check for missing or outdated meta information
   - Ensure canonical URLs are correctly implemented

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track search engine indexing of the canonical URLs
   - Monitor for any duplicate content issues
   - Check Google Search Console for any meta tag related warnings

This implementation ensures that search engines properly understand the structure of the site, particularly the multiple entry points to the resume builder functionality, and helps prevent duplicate content issues by clearly indicating the canonical URLs.
